# Penpot Helm Chart (test)

[![Artifact Hub](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/penpot)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=penpot)

This repository contains charts for Penpot (https://penpot.app) project.


## What is Penpot

Penpot is the first **open-source** design tool for design and code collaboration. Designers can create stunning designs, interactive prototypes, design systems at scale, while developers enjoy ready-to-use code and make their workflow easy and fast. And all of this with no handoff drama.

Penpot is available on browser and [self host](https://penpot.app/self-host). It‚Äôs web-based and works with open standards (SVG, CSS and HTML). And last but not least, it‚Äôs free!


## Usage

The charts can be added using following command:

```
helm repo add penpot https://helm.penpot.app/
```
